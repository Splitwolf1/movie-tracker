## Current Status
- Last Updated: July 26, 2024
- Current Phase: Phase 6 - Technical Improvements
- Next Milestone: Complete Integration Tests and Begin Phase 7
- Progress Update: We have successfully implemented the admin dashboard with role-based access control, content management with CRUD operations, content moderation system, comprehensive user management, analytics dashboard with data visualization and reporting, and system management with health monitoring, backup functionality, and log management. The platform now has full offline support with proper handling for SSR environments. We have completed the performance optimization tasks by implementing lazy loading for all feature modules, code splitting using the DeferredLoadingDirective, and image optimization with responsive images, srcset, and lazy loading. We have also completed all security enhancements including CSRF protection with token validation, rate limiting for API requests with configurable time windows, and comprehensive input validation to prevent common security vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection attacks. We have established a testing framework with Jest for unit tests and Cypress for E2E tests, with initial tests for key components and services. We have added comprehensive documentation including JSDoc code comments, detailed API documentation, and user guides. Our next milestone is completing the integration tests before moving to Phase 7 for final polishing and launch preparations.

## Notes
- This roadmap is a living document and will be updated as we progress
- Priorities may shift based on user feedback and requirements
- Each feature will be marked as completed when fully implemented and tested
